## Human Object Detection Tracking Input Vectorization for ViT


#### A task that involves real-time object detection of person objects, conversion into a specified input format, and then feeding into ViT (Vision Transformer) as input:
* Detect person objects with bounding box detection.
* Track the detected person objects in real-time.
* Listen in real-time, and simultaneously, have the ViT also listen.
